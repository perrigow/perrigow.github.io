		<h3>BPMCat</h3>
		<p>A web service and web application rolled into one. BPMCat is a
		web service that supplies Tempo Player, a Android mobile applicaiton,
		with tempos (beats per minute) for a collection of songs. When no
		tempo exists for a particular song, the software retrieves tempos
		from a crowd-sourced web service, to populate it's database.</p>
		<p>It is also a web application, BPMCat has a admin console, where
		an admin can managed the tempos in the database. The admin console
		is a collection of web pages, which connects to the database for all
		operations, and provides statistics for scheduled tasks.</p>

		<h3>Wednesday Doubles</h3>
		<p>This website was built, using Pico, to display league
		information for the Wednesday Doubles. Being the secretary of this
		league, I decided to post the results online. Most bowlers will
		print out the standings sheets for themselves, which allows me to
		just print one standings sheet per pair.</p>

		<h3>BPMTag</h3>
		<p>BPMTag is a future desktop application which will be used to
		crowd-source tempos for BPMCat. The application scans a collection
		of music on the users computer, generates metadata including BPM,
		and tags the song with the BPM for use in Tempo Player.</p>
		<p>Once the music is tagged, there will be an option to send the
		metadata to BPMCat so other users can benefit. No personal information
		is sent, just the metadata for the song.</p>
